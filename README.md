# K-Factor

K-Factor is a dynamic audio plugin designed to enhance punch, impact, and perceived energy in sound. It focuses on bringing life and movement to tracks without sacrificing control or clarity.

Built as an open-source project, K-Factor is intended for both creative producers and developers interested in audio processing.

---

## Features

- Dynamic processing focused on punch and impact
- Designed for drums, buses, and full mixes
- Clean signal path with aggressive potential
- Simple controls that encourage experimentation
- Lightweight and responsive

K-Factor is not about transparency alone. It is about energy.

---

## Philosophy

K-Factor was built around one idea:

Energy matters.

Sometimes subtle control is not enough. Sometimes sound needs to hit harder, move more, and feel alive. K-Factor exists in that space between precision and aggression.

If it feels too much, pull it back.  
If it feels safe, push it further.
